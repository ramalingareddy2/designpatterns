class Account implements Serializable {
  private int accountNo;
  private String accountHolderName;
  private String accountType;
  private double balance;
  // accessors
}

There are 2 magic methods are there in serialization process
externalization
1. Object readObject(ObjectInputStream ois) {}
2. void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream oos) {}

data transformation
3. Object readResolve() {}
4. Object writeReplace() {}

These methods are called magic methods as these are jvm contractual methods that jvm promise to call during the time of serialization/deserialization. and are no where declared as part of java api, like either in Object class or not part of any interface.
